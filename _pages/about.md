Hello! I'm Steven Hespeler, welcome to my page! Currently, I am a PhD candidate at New Mexico State University awaiting my doctoral defense. 


My Research and Work
------
My work is focused in the machine/statistical learning research area. [My dissertation](https://tov-nephesh.github.io/cv/) was focused on utilizing a Deep Learning (DL) technique for predicting State of Charge (SOC) in a Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV). In order to do so, I created a Continuous Lag Control (CLC) algorithm for monitoring and adjusting the size of the training data during a Time-Series Cross Validation (TSCV) method during a Long-Short Term (LSTM) architecture.


My Life At A Glance
------
Both of my parents are from Connecticut. We're a shoreline family with my Mom having grown up in New London, CT and my Dad in Groton, CT. I split my childhood between Groton and the beautiful town of [North Stoningtion, CT](https://www.northstoningtonct.gov/home/pages/about-north-stonington), never having lived more than eight minutes from the ocean. 

Background
------

In 2004 I enrolled at [Roger Williams University](https://www.rwu.edu/) in the [School of Engineering, Computing and Construction Management](https://www.rwu.edu/academics/schools-and-colleges/seccm). There I was granted to opportunity to study engineering on the beautiful campus located in [Bristol RI](https://www.bristolri.gov/). Bristol is a gorgeous town rich in American history, I made life long friendships and truly cheerish my time spent there. I completed my studies from RWU in 2008 with a Bachelors of Science in Engineering. In 2010 I transitioned from the shoreline to desert life in the Southwest. I began Graduate School at [New Mexico State University](https://www.nmsu.edu/) in 2010 located in [Las Cruces NM](https://www.las-cruces.org/). At NMSU I joined the great faculty and student board in the [Department of Industrial Engineering (IE)](https://ie.nmsu.edu/)! I completed a [Masters of Science](https://tov-nephesh.github.io/cv/) degree in 2012 with a focus on statistical analysis of a novel Wood-Polymer Composite (WPC). While completing my Masters I was blessed with the oppprtunity to work with great professors and students and participate in a number of [conferences](https://engr.nmsu.edu/news_11_nta/). Then, I jumped right into the PhD program where I worked on [drones](https://photo.nmsu.edu/photos/view/27647) at [PSL](https://psl.nmsu.edu/) on campus and continued my work as a teaching and graduate assistant in the IE Department.
